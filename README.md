## Scalability
The following table shows how algorithms with different complexities scale when given different numbers of inputs. Note: some values are rounded.

|Complexity |1|10      |100  |
|-----------|-|--------|-----|
|O(1)       |1| 1      |1    |
|O(log N)   |0| 2      |5    |
|O(N)       |1|10      |100                            |
|O(N log N) |0|20      |461                            |
|O(N^2)     |1|100     |10000                          | 
|O(2^N)     |1|1024    |1267650600228229401496703205376|
