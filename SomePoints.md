#### 1) Generally loops are turned into recursive function when they are compiled or interpreted
#### 2) We can concatenate two ``` Circular linked list in O(1) Complexity ```
#### 3) Empty Tree is also a valid Binary Tree
#### 4) Height of empty Binary Tree = -1
#### 5) If one of the traversal is ```Inorder then the tree constructed uniquely, otherwise not ```
#### 6) If there are n nodes then ```2^n-n different trees ```
#### 7) Mini no. Of swap - Selection Sort
#### 8) Quicksort on already sorted array gives worst case.
